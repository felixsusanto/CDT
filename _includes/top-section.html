It requires us to extend our design knowledge to learn new skill of UX fundamentals and Front End in building better design solutions. Our goal is to deliver design that is not only visually pleasing but also meet the user needs.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">With the new direction, we feel there is a need to make our team’s name more intuitive and self-explanatory that portrays the team expertise. Looking at standard practise in design industry, we decided to make a change to call ourselves <b>“Creative Design Team”</b>.
